Email spam detection using machine learning
We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.


In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
started!
here i have used different libraries and packages like pandas for data analysis ,nummpy for mathamatical cslculations 
here i used naive bayas algorithm for classification of data .
i used sklearn for feature extraction
